Breast Cancer Prediction App

📌 Overview

This application is a Breast Cancer Diagnosis Predictor developed using Streamlit, a Python-based framework designed for creating interactive web applications. The tool leverages Gaussian probability distributions to categorize tumors as either benign (0) or malignant (1). Users can upload a CSV file containing tumor attributes, and the system automatically processes the input data before making predictions using a pre-trained Gaussian model. This model estimates the likelihood of malignancy based on statistical probability, enhancing diagnostic efficiency for medical professionals and researchers.

🚀 Features

Seamless CSV File Upload: Enables users to upload a CSV file containing multiple tumor-related features for bulk predictions.

Automated Data Processing: The app systematically removes irrelevant columns, handles missing values, and selects only significant attributes for prediction.

Gaussian-Based Probabilistic Classification: Implements a Gaussian probability distribution model to assess tumor characteristics and make predictions.

Intuitive & Interactive User Interface: The application is built with Streamlit, providing an accessible and user-friendly experience, even for those without technical expertise.

Real-Time Prediction Generation: The system instantly computes classifications upon data upload, eliminating delays in obtaining results.

Robust Error Handling: Alerts users about incorrect file formats, missing or erroneous data, and provides guidance on corrective measures.

🛠 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ Install Required Dependencies

Ensure that Python is installed on your system. Then, install all required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Launch the Application

Execute the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

streamlit run app.py

This will launch the Breast Cancer Prediction App in your default web browser.

📜 Usage Instructions

Start the application by running the command above.

Click the Upload CSV button and select a dataset containing tumor characteristics.

The system automatically preprocesses the data, applies Gaussian probability-based classification, and presents predictions.

View the classification results, which indicate whether each tumor is predicted to be benign (0) or malignant (1).

🧠 How the Prediction Model Works

Data Preprocessing: The system filters out non-essential columns such as id and any unnamed entries.

Feature Selection: It extracts only the most informative tumor characteristics for classification.

Gaussian Classification: The app loads pre-trained parameters from gaussian_parameters.pkl, calculating probability densities for both benign and malignant cases.

Prediction Logic: If the probability of malignancy exceeds that of benignancy, the system classifies the tumor as malignant (1); otherwise, it is classified as benign (0).

Result Interpretation: Provides detailed probability distributions and confidence scores for each classification.

17.99,10.38,122.8,1001,0.1184,0.2776,0.3001,0.2419
20.57,17.77,132.9,1326,0.08474,0.07864,0.0869,0.1812

⚠️ Important Considerations

Ensure that the uploaded CSV file follows the expected format, with column names identical to those used in model training.

The app utilizes a pre-trained Gaussian model, and its accuracy depends on how closely the uploaded data matches the training set.

Missing, incorrect, or poorly formatted data may lead to errors or unreliable predictions.

Since this is a statistical probabilistic model, predictions should always be validated by medical professionals before drawing any conclusions or making clinical decisions.

🏗 Future Enhancements

Advanced Error Handling: Improve the detection of improperly formatted CSV files and provide better corrective suggestions.

More Sophisticated Model Training: Enhance classification accuracy by incorporating additional machine learning algorithms.

Deployment & Cloud Hosting: Make the app accessible online via Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or similar hosting services.

Data Visualization Enhancements: Introduce graphical representations of prediction results, including probability distributions and feature importance.

Multi-Model Support: Enable users to compare Gaussian classification with alternative machine learning techniques.
